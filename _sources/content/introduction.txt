PyroTRF-ID stands for pyrosequencing-based T-RF identification.

The pyrotrfid program is a package written in Python. It is designed to process a specific kind of high throughput sequencing data in a specific manner. You execute the analysis pipeline by calling the ``pyrotrfid`` executable.

This software was written in January 2012 by Lucas Sinclair after first developments by Grégory Lefebvre, at the time employees at the Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Core Facitlity (BBCF) at Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL, Switzerland).

This software was developed in collaboration with David Weissbrodt, Noam Shani and Christog Holliger from the Laboratory for Environmental Biotechnology (LBE) at EPFL, who aimed to link pyrosequencing and T-RFLP data for the study of bacterial community structure and dynamics in natural and environmental engineering systems.
