This software was written in January 2012 by Lucas Sinclair, at the time an employee at the Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Core Facility (BBCF). He did it with the help and good advice from Jacques Rougemont.

This software was intended to be used by two PhD candidates working in the Laboratory for Environmental Biotechnology (LBE). They had sequencing data that needed to be analysed.
